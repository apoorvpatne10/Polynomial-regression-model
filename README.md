# Polynomial-regression-model

A reputated human-resource team is working for a big company. They need to hire a new employee in this company. They need to make an offer for this potential new employee and negotiate a suitable salary for this employee. The new employee states that he has 20+ years of experience and earned 160k+ in his previous job. So this employee asking for at least 160k or more as his salary. A person from HR team wanted to do a background check on this employee to know about his previous 160k+ salary, but unfortunately all he could manage was a simple dataset consisting of 10 different positions along with their salaries of the previous company. HR member analyses this dataset and obtains a non-linear pattern between the position levels and their associated salaries. So I've made non-linear regression model to predict a salary for a given level/position in a company, to check whether he's not bluffing about his work experience. All of the work is being done on python using scikit learn, and matplotlib libraries for visual representation. 
We can clearly see that as the degree of the polynomial increases, the predictions using polynomial regression becomes more precise.
